# Tubelight Simulation with Digital Clock  

This project demonstrates how to create a simulation of a tube light with a built-in digital clock using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The tube light has three states:  

1. **Before turning on** - The tube light appears off.  
2. **When turning on** - The light illuminates with an orange glow.  
3. **When fully turned on** - A digital clock displays the current date and time.  

The design takes inspiration from a **Nixie Tube Clock**, giving it a retro-futuristic aesthetic.

## Features  

- **Real-time clock**: Displays the current date and time dynamically.  
- **Three states of light**: Before turning on, during illumination, and after turning on fully.  
- **Vintage design**: Mimics the appearance of a Nixie tube clock.

## Demo  

### 1. Before Turning On  
The tube light appears off, with no illumination or display.

### 2. Turning On  
The light begins to glow with an orange hue, giving a warm ambiance.

### 3. Fully Turned On  
The digital clock inside the tube light is fully illuminated, displaying the current time and date.
